# Search and Destroy
Once a text adventure game, but now something much more interesting.
In Search and Destroy, you are a detective and have to find details about a planned attack from some encrypted files in order to intercept the attack.
To decrypt the files, you must figure out each file's encryption algorithm using the information available to you.
